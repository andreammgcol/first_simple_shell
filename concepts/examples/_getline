Reads a line from stream, delimited by the newline character.
The delimiter character is included as part of the line, unless the end of the
file is reached.

- The first thing getline does is allocate memory if necessary.
- The second thing getline does is update the size variable.
- The third thing getline does is read the line of the file and stores it into the string.
- The fourth thing getline does is return length of that string. 

Returns: The number of characters written, excluding the terminating NUL character. The value -1 is returned
if an error occurs, or if end-of-file is reached.

Proto: ssize_t getline(char **lineptr, size_t *linecapp, FILE *stream);
